CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first

do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

  git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
